## Back Story
Curious about how games are made, I found out about Game Dev & Unity at the age of 12, made a bunch of crappy stuff then somehow transferred into doing multiple freelancing projects for clients around the globe.

## Projects?
all of the following are freelancing projects in some way or another:
- **[Vocabs Break](https://picalica.com/go/2629)** (Paid Product): mobile word-guessing game.
- **[Flap](https://picalica.com/go/2349)** (Paid Product): flappy bird clone (who would've thought).
- **[Heads or Tails: meow edition]()** (Free web game): heads or tails but for cats (client's idea, no questions)
  
there are more, but most of them are not so interesting to share, or/and are private (client doesn't want to publish the work).

## Art
You can find my pixel art at: https://www.reddit.com/user/zaidmermam/submitted/
